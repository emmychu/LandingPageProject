This is the landing page with updated interactivity!
Although a majority of the css remains, I have added:
1. Navigation bar interactivity via javascript
    a) The navigation bar auto-hides after 5 seconds
    b) Upon clicking the section number it should automatically scroll to the destination
2. An anchor element that scrolls to the top via javascript
3. When each section is fully displayed on the page, the class should change to active and the preset css should appear for each active section.
